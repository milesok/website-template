One of my goals during this COVID-19 shutdown is to organize the things I'm learning and creating into something I can use to share them so I'm making this site with GitHub pages and I'll start posting a whole bunch of (hopefully) cool stuff on here.

This first post is boring but it's more for me than y'all so sorry. Here's a fun YouTube video to keep you entertained for now: {% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}

Here are some of the ways I want to make this site useful for myself and anyone from the internet who happens to find themself here:

#### Projects
I want to use this space to document each larger project I undertake, both the process and writeup of the end product. The first one of these will be the process for creating and developing this website.

#### Posts
I also want to do some one-off posts for things like small questions, tutorials, cool thiings I read, etc. These will be shorter and self contained.

#### Learning pages
Inspired by the Feynman Technique, I want to make notes over stuff I've learned in a format that hopefully will make it easy for others to learn from, or for myself to go back to if I ever need to.
